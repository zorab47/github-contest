h1. Github 2009 Contest

This repository is my submission for the "Github Contest":http://contest.github.com.

h2. About My Solution

Factors I considered:

* A repository owner's other repositories.
* Overlapping repositories from two users deemed similar to the user in question.
* Guesses from repositories similar to a user's own repositories as determined by:
** Programming language similarities
** Number of users overlapping within the repository's watchers and the watchers a user knows of via his watched repositories
** Whether or not the repository is fork or source of the user's repository
* Popular repositories (both by number of watchers and number of forks)
* Unwatched fork source repositories (as suggested by "cardmagic":http://github.com/cardmagic)

h2. Running

Using "JRuby":http://jruby.org is suggested as it allows threads to work on multiple CPUs, but the code executes just as well using the ruby 1.8 or ruby 1.9 interpreters. 

To run the project and genereate a results.txt file in the current directory:

bc. $ jruby attempt.rb
