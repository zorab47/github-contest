h1. Github 2009 Contest

This repository is my submission for the "Github Contest":http://contest.github.com.

h2. About My Solution

Factors I considered:

* A repository owner's other repositories.
* Overlapping repositories from two users deemed similar to the user in question.
* Guesses from repositories similar to a user's own repositories as determined by:
** Programming language similarities
** Number of users overlapping within the repository's watchers and the watchers a user knows of via his watched repositories
** Whether or not the repository is fork or source of the user's repository
* Unwatched fork source repositories (as suggested by "cardmagic":http://github.com/cardmagic)
